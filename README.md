# MedScore Assist

### 🩺 A Doctor-Focused ML Tool for Holistic Chronic Disease Risk Assessment

---

## 📌 Overview

Lifestyle-related diseases like **heart disease**, **obesity**, and **hypertension** are on the rise, creating new challenges for the healthcare system. Traditional diagnostics often ignore lifestyle factors, resulting in incomplete assessments and treatment plans.

**MedScore Assist** bridges this gap by combining:

- 🔬 **Clinical data** (e.g., cholesterol, triglycerides, blood sugar)  
- 🧍 **Lifestyle data** (e.g., smoking habits, BMI, allergies)

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To build an ML-powered diagnostic tool that:

- Predicts chronic disease risks  
- Generates comprehensive health profiles  
- Provides actionable insights for doctors  
- Enhances clinical decision-making and patient care

---

## 🌟 Key Features

- 🧠 **Machine Learning-based prediction** for:
  - Heart Disease  
  - Obesity Risk  
  - Hypertension Risk  

- 🧪 **Integration of lab test data** (HDL, LDL, triglycerides, etc.)  
- 🧍 **Lifestyle analysis** (smoking, physical activity, allergies)  
- 📊 **Health scoring system** for each risk factor  
- 🧾 **Doctor dashboard** for clear and summarized reports

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Input Collection:** Combines clinical (lab results) and non-clinical (lifestyle) data  
2. **Model Prediction:** Trained ML models predict risk levels  
3. **Score Generation:** Assigns scores based on prediction results  
4. **Doctor View:** Displays actionable feedback in a user-friendly interface
